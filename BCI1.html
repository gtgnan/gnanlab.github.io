                                    The objective of the proposed research is to address some of the fundamental challenges in Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) systems. Brain-computer interfaces have surfaced as a powerful and attractive modality in human-machine interaction. BCIs establish a channel for communicating with machines directly, bypassing the physical constraints and limi- tations of the body. However, EEG-based non-invasive BCIs also suffer from 2 fundamental challenges, among other problems. Firstly, since they measure the electrical activity in the brain externally on the scalp, it significantly reduces the signal-to-noise ratio. This leads to low detection accuracy and poor performance by classification models. Secondly, BCI signals do not generalize well across other individuals owing to a high amount of signal variability between subjects. This makes it extremely difficult to re-use a machine learning model built by using one user’s data on others and requires tedious re-training on new users. In our lab research, we work with brain-computer Interfaces along three research thrusts, namely, transfer learning for BCIs, approaches to enhance detection for low SNR BCI signals, and exploring futuristic applications using BCIs which dovetail seamlessly with an increasingly connected world. We outline our 3 research thrusts as follows:
                                    
                                    
<!--                                    In this work, we attempt to address these problems using a systems approach. We view these challenges as subproblems in a wider system of brain-computer interfaces and their appli- cations. While there is neuroscientific and biomedical literature that aims to address these challenges, we propose solutions that aim to enhance the functionality of BCIs as part of a larger system. We use several methods in order to tackle these fundamental roadblocks present in BCIs.-->

We attempt to address low SNR in BCI signals by investigating how BCI signals respond to the presence of more than one stimulus and how these elicited signals interact with each other. We study how changes in one signal provide information about the other signal, which helps us with detection, attribution, synchronization, etc.-->

                                        <h2>1. Transfer Learning for Brain-Computer Interfaces
                                            </h2>
                                        
                                        <p>
                                        We primarily look at the Error Potential signal (ErrP) for this thrust, a signal known for its poor generalization.  In this work, we present a method that not only shrinks
                                        the re-calibration overhead for this signal to a tiny fraction of the original but
                                        also provides a generalization accuracy that approaches that of
                                        intra-user models. We use transfer learning to transfer relevant
                                        parts of our detection model using divergence calculations in the
                                        signal probability space and use few-shot learning to adapt the
                                        model to a new user. We demonstrate our method on a dataset
                                        collected in our lab and obtain state-of-the-art results. <break>
                                            We also explored a multi-human detection model that leverages the observation of multiple human beings in detecting the presence of an error potential. One method to overcome this is to utilize
                                            multiple users’ observations and average their signals to get an
                                            aggregate signal. However, the second problem arises as BCI
                                            signals generalize poorly to other subjects which makes user-
                                            specific training mandatory for the model to perform well across
                                            the board or generalize well to unseen data. This places a lot
                                            of overhead on new users who want to use a BCI device in the
                                            form of calibration and training. We investigated these
                                            problems and proposed using multiplicity as a viable solution dimension.

                                            novel algorithm to mitigate the associated covariate shift in the probability space using partial target-aware optimal transport. We demonstrate
                                            our method on an ErrP dataset collected in our lab. Our

                                        <p>While brain signals
                                        like the error potential (ErrP) showcase low SNR and have
                                        lower detection accuracy, there are other kinds of signals that
                                        showcase high detection rates and resilience to noise. Motivated
                                        by this disparity, we ask ourselves if the abstract cognitive states
                                        involved in the evocation of such resilient signals be leveraged
                                        to amplify or augment the weaker signals, and thus provide

                                        designing an experiment to interface these two kinds of signals
                                        and collect EEG data in our lab through human trials. We

    <h2>3. Transformative BCI applications to aid ML models and humans
        </h2>
    
    <p>As BCIs help us gauge user intent without needing explicit communication, they can be helpful for human-aided or human-in-the-loop systems that enhancing the performance of AI agents. We outline our work where we used implicit user feedback using BCIs to accelerate RL agents. <br>
    
    Providing Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents with
    human feedback can dramatically improve various aspects of
    learning. However, previous methods require human observer
    to give inputs explicitly (e.g., press buttons, voice interface),
    burdening the human in the loop of RL agent’s learning process.
    Further, providing explicit human advise (feedback) continuously
    is not always possible or too restrictive, e.g., autonomous driving,
    disabled rehabilitation, etc. In this work, we investigate capturing
    human’s intrinsic reactions as implicit (and natural) feedback
    through EEG in the form of error-related potentials (ErrP),
    providing a natural and direct way for humans to improve the RL
    agent learning. As such, the human intelligence can be integrated
    via implicit feedback with RL algorithms to accelerate the
    learning of RL agent. We develop three reasonably complex 2D
    discrete navigational games to experimentally evaluate the overall
    performance of the proposed work. And the motivation of using
    ErrPs as feedbacks is also verified by subjective experiments.
    Major contributions of our work are as follows, (i) we propose
    and experimentally validate the zero-shot learning of ErrPs,
    where the ErrPs can be learned for one game, and transferred to
    other unseen games, (ii) we propose a novel RL framework for
    integrating implicit human feedbacks via ErrPs with RL agent,
    improving the label efficiency and robustness to human mistakes,
    and (iii) compared to prior works, we scale the application of
    ErrPs to reasonably complex environments, and demonstrate the
    significance of our approach for accelerated learning through real
    user experiments

    <p>We also explored the implicit security offered by brain signals in applications like authentication and leveraged the highly individualistic signals like eye-blinks to design an authentication system. we specifically focused on the EEG signal corresponding to the human eye-blink to create an authentication system that
    could be used to distinguish between multiple users accurately
    and efficiently while also being burden-less and convenient to the
    users. We use a dataset of eye-blink related EEG signals, collected
    from 20 users, to study our solution. Our results show that blink
    signals can be used for accurately distinguishing between different
    users and hence can be used for authentication.</p>
